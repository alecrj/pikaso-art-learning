🏁 THE VERDICT
Current State: NOT FAANG READY
Strengths:

✅ Solid architecture foundation
✅ Unique learning angle
✅ Good iPad optimization start
✅ Professional engine structure

Critical Weaknesses:

❌ No testing (5/100)
❌ No monitoring (0/100)
❌ No analytics (0/100)
❌ Security unknowns
❌ Performance gaps

FAANG Acquisition Readiness: 2/10
Would Apple acquire this? No - too many gaps
Would Google acqui-hire? Possibly - good architecture
Netflix-grade reliability? No - needs 6+ months
Meta social features? No - complete rebuild needed
